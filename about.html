    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        My ultimate goal is to work to provide value to my clients, gain their trust and keep it.
        <br>How can it be in everyday work ?
        <br>By being in a team who takes your needs into account and makes sure to develop what you expect.
        <br>To do so, I speak with domain experts, challenge the specifications so I can reduce uncertainty to the minimum.

        <br><br>Moreover, I am convinced by agility in IT development. Being agile, in my opinion, is first being able to deliver at any time, and being able to react fast to your feedback, may they happen any time during the development cycle.

        <br><br>We can often see teams crawling under bad software quality, instead of spending time providing value with serenity. To reverse this trend, I constantly seek to improve the quality of what is produced by anchoring myself into software craftsmanship practices, by working on my communication, my transparency, my information sharing, and a continuous improvement of the team, process and development chain.

    <h1>Why this blog ?</h1>
    <p>
        I use this blog first for myself to store some synthetic "how to" or summaries of books I read, conferences, meetups, etc.
        <br>
        I put all of that publicly so if it can be useful to someone else, that's even better.
